# Application Tracker

I am creating an Application Tracker web application to monitor and analyze statistics related to my job applications. This project is purely for personal use and self-study. This project will provide statistics in relation to application such as response rate, average response time, etc with additional functionality when necessary.

## ðŸš€ About Me

I am an alumni of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee with a Bachelor's of Science in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. Currently still looking for employment, but thought this would be a good way to record my efforts due to the current job market and my lack of projects.

## Documentation/Tech Stack

This project is primarily based in the Django framework for most if not all the front-end and back-end. Bootstrap is the primary styling used for this project. Charts are provided and used from amcharts.com.
